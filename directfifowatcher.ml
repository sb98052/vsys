(** directfifowatcher.ml: Routines to handle non-persistent scripts *)
(* Semantics:
 *      - The 'out' descriptor must be opened first
 *      - As soon as the backend script dies, the connection to the entry is
 *      closed.
 *      - To avoid user-inflicted pain, all entries are opened at the time
 *      that they are created. Reopening these entries is a little complicated
 *      but nevertheless sound:
 *              * When a script dies, its fd is reopened
 *              * If a script fails to execute, its fd is closed and reopened to
 *              beat a race that can happen when the user closes the connection
 *              before the script can be launched.
