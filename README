# Vsys

[USENIX '11 paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixatc11/vsys-programmable-sudo)

```vsys -backend <backend dir> -conffile <configuration file>```

`backend` contains a set of executables  that read from `stdin` and write to `stdout`. vsys safely maps these programs to FIFO pipes in the front end.
conffile contains the list of frontends in which pipes should appear, in the format <directory> <slice name> with each entry on a newline. 

vsys also supports a file descriptor-passing interface.
